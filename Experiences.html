<h33>Volunteering with intellectually disabled people with the ANFAS association</h33><br /><br />
<h35>The volunteering was organized by the Religious of Mary Immaculate. We meet two days a week and help them with homework and the learning process. Then we would play games, do therapy, and try to be an emotional support for them.</h35><br /><br />
<h36>I was a monitor during the summer in a camp with intellectually disabled people and with developmental disorders. For 15 days we slept in a hostel in another city where we took care of all the care they required as well as organizing activities and adapted trips so that they could enjoy the summer.</h36><br /><br />
